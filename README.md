# Feedback Form

## About the Project
This project is a feedback form I've built to get feedbacks on my portfolio. 
It consists of 4 sections:
* Contact information
* Design review
* Content review
* Code review 

The project is part of the Responsive Web Design Certification projects of freeCodeCamp, you can access the details [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-survey-form-project/build-a-survey-form).

* Git & GitHub

## Further Improvements
### Do
* Add a preview link for mobile
